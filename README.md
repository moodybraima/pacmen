# pacmen

## Description

PacMan is a game you can play by adding as many pacmen as you wish then move the images to bounce against the confines of the rectangular area on the screen. 

## How to Run

First click on the button “Add PacMan” to add the iconic images as many as you wish. Then click on “Start Game” to watch the icons bounce around. You may add additional images if you wish. Each time you click again on the “Start Game”, the images move faster.

## Roadmap

One change you can add to the game could be changing the size of the image. Another could make the game change the size as it hits the wall by shrinking then expand as it bounces away from the edge of the area.
